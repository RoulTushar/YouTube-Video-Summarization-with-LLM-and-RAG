# YouTube Video Summarization with LLM and RAG

This project provides a streamlined approach to summarizing YouTube video content by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and prompt engineering. By inputting a YouTube video URL, this notebook fetches and processes video transcripts to generate concise and informative summaries.

### Features
- YouTube Transcript Extraction: Automatically fetches transcripts for videos when available.
- Text Preprocessing and Chunking: Cleans and segments video transcript text for efficient model processing.
- Prompt Engineering: Custom prompt templates designed to guide the model toward producing accurate and concise summaries.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Integrates document retrieval into the generation process to improve response relevance.
- Summary Generation: Uses a Large Language Model to provide detailed summaries based on transcript content.

### How it works
- Extract Transcripts: Given a YouTube video URL, the notebook retrieves the video’s transcript.
- Chunking and Preprocessing: The transcript text is split into manageable chunks.
- Prompt Engineering with LangChain: Prompt templates are created to guide the model’s response.
- RAG with Large Language Models: The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and contextually relevant summaries.
- Output Summary: The model outputs a coherent summary of the video content.

- Here's a refined version that organizes each section for clarity and flow:

### 1. **Setup and Installation**
   - Install and upgrade necessary packages: `langchain`, `langchain-community`, and `langchain-together`.

### 2. **Overview of Together AI**
   - Introduce the Together AI platform.
   - Highlight key features and benefits, including support for various open-source language models, flexibility in model selection, and scalable infrastructure.

### 3. **Initializing the Language Model with Together AI**
   - Import `ChatTogether` from LangChain.
   - Initialize the language model using Together AI’s API, which simplifies the process of working with LLMs.

### 4. **Understanding Document Loaders in LangChain**
   - Explain the role of document loaders in standardizing data input from various sources.
   - Describe the two main types of document loaders:
     - **File Type-Based Loaders**: Designed for formats like CSV, PDF, and HTML.
     - **Data Source-Based Loaders**: Specifically for content retrieval from sources like YouTube, GitHub, and Wikipedia.

### 5. **Loading YouTube Transcripts with YouTube Document Loader**
   - Install the required packages: `youtube_transcript_api` and `pytube`.
   - Import `YoutubeLoader` from LangChain.
   - Retrieve and load the transcript from a specified YouTube video URL.

### 6. **Processing and Displaying the YouTube Transcript**
   - Show the raw transcript content for initial review.
   - Use the language model to summarize and distill key points from the video transcript for a high-level overview.

### 7. **Introduction to Prompt Templates**
   - Define `PromptTemplate` and its purpose in LangChain.
   - Create a custom prompt template specifically designed to guide the model in summarizing video content.

### 8. **Summarizing with LLMChain**
   - Set up an `LLMChain` instance using the custom prompt template.
   - Generate a structured, concise summary of the video transcript, utilizing the language model through the LLMChain for a streamlined output.
